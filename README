// PROGRAM ASSIGNMENT 4                                        
// FILE NAME : README            
// PROGRAM PURPOSE :                                           
//    This program has a Santa, many elves, and many reindeer
//	Santa is sleeping and can only be woken up by three elves
//	if they have questions, or if all of the reindeer are back
//	from the bahamas        
// ----------------------------------------------------------- 


1. I guarantee that only three elves ask a question by using a semaphore with an initial
	value of 3, so that only three continue without getting blocked. Then I only 
	signal that semaphore when all 3 elves have had their questions answered

2. No elf will leave before the question is answered because it is blocked by AnsweringQuestion Semaphore and then by Release semaphore

3. No other elves can cut in because before an elf can even see if enough have asked questions,
	they are blocked until the other 3 have come back, using Queue.Wait()

4. Santa cannot answer questions while he is sleeping because he either takes the reindeer to 
	deliver presents, or answer elves questions and then goes back to sleep and is blocked
	by the SantaSleeping semaphore which is initialized to 0, so he is blocked and waiting/
	sleeping until it is signaled/woken up

5. The reindeer is the last one coming back from vacation, because I count down how many reindeer
	have come back from the Bahamas with the variable 'globalReindeer' and each time
	a reindeer comes back, it decrements globalReindeer and checks if it is 0, if it is not
	then the reindeer just waits. If it is 0, then it is the last reindeer and it wakes up 
	Santa

6. I make sure that Santa always handles the reindeer first because when he is signaled/woken up
	he checks the reindeer with an if statement and then if that is false, he checks the 
	elves in the else if statement. Therefor the reindeer are tended to first

7. The reindeer are blocked by semaphores in WaitOthers, WaitSleigh, then after they flyOff they 
	are blocked again. Santa must signal for them to go from one to the next. After the 
	delivery is done, it is printed, and then Santa signals them using ReleaseReingdeer one 
	last time to let them go back to the Bahamas and he goes back to sleep.  

8. When Santa is getting the sleigh ready or delivering toys, the elves can signal Santa
	but he won't see that until he goes back to sleep and the SantaSleeping Semaphore
	doesn't block him. Also the elves will be blocked by the AnsweringQuestions semaphore
